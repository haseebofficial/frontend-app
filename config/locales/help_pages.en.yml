    conversation:
      title: "Interpretation at negotiations"
      text: |
        <p>Important negotiations with the foreign business partner are coming, and the qualified interpreter is necessary, because not all staff of your company who will participate in negotiations, are fluent speakers of the corresponding foreign language. The success of the forthcoming negotiations can depend on a right choice of the interpreter and accuracy of the interpretation.</p>
        <p>While choosing the interpreter it is important to consider type of the forthcoming negotiations as well as additional knowledge and skills which can be necessary for the interpreter. For Interpreter could render the service successfully, it is better to clue the interpreter in advance by telling him the theme of negotiations and providing with available materials for preparation. It is preferable for the Interpreter to have experience of participation in such negotiations or have enough time for preparation. Both are even better.</p>
        <p>
          <b>There are different kinds of negotiations:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>preliminary negotiations with discussion of possible joint projects or offer of any products or services;</li>
          <li>negotiations with signing of documents (protocol of intentions, cooperation agreement, etc.);</li>
          <li>work negotiations with discussion of joint projects implementation progress;</li>
          <li>negotiations with the purpose of prejudicial settlement of arisen disputes and mutual claims.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Duration of negotiations can be different:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>short negotiations lasting from 30 minutes to 1-2 hours</li>
          <li>long negotiations lasting from one to several days</li>
          <p>
            <b>Place of negotiations can be different:</b>
          </p>
          <li>at one of negotiation parties office;</li>
          <li>in hotel or airport;</li>
          <li>in conference or forum lobby.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Negotiations can also differ in country they are held in:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>negotiations within the country when your company acts as a host;</li>
          <li>negotiations during abroad trip of your delegation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Interpretation at all stated kinds of negotiations has its peculiarities. But from the point of view of ensuring interpretation quality, the way the process is organized is essential. Consecutive (sentence-for-sentence) interpretation is usually applied at negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is connected with the fact that:
          <ul>
            <li>not all even skilled interpreters have skills of professional simultaneous interpretation;</li>
            <li>for simultaneous interpretation it is necessary to think of the corresponding stationary or portable equipment in advance;</li>
            <li>business negotiations are often held in private, and in this situation consecutive interpretation encourages the atmosphere of direct communication between participants of negotiations better.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
    exhibition:
      title: "Interpretation at an exhibition"
      text: |
        <p>You fly to a foreign exhibition as a specialist-visitor and you want to use services of the local interpreter.</p>
        <p>Trip to the international specialized exhibition abroad is always a special event. To make exhibition visit most effective, it is important to break a language barrier, to find a common language for business communication. Skilled interpreter will help you to do it. Interpretation at an exhibition has certain peculiarities and isn't similar to any other type of interpretation; therefore to escort individual expert or a  group of experts during exhibition visit, it is better to find the interpreter, who has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>knowledge of the corresponding terminology in two languages;</li>
          <li>good skills of oral bilingual interpretation;</li>
          <li>loud voice and clear articulation;</li>
          <li>ability to grasp and interpret the main thing, despite the mass of distracting and stirring factors;</li>
          <li>ability to adapt quickly in unusual situation;</li>
          <li>skill to communicate and ability to attach unknown interlocutor;</li>
          <li>increased mobility and physical endurance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Knowing not one, but several foreign languages will be additional plus for the interpreter. Let’s say, not only German, but also English if it is a question of exhibition visit in Germany. After all among participants of an exhibition there can appear those who know German not well.</p>
        <p>Interpretation at an exhibition is a public type of interpretation therefore appearance of the interpreter can play an important role.</p>
        <p>In practice it is quite often when one interpreter is ordered for all the time of stay in the country. As a rule, any skilled professional interpreter is able to provide the interpretation of business visits and meetings out of an exhibition, besides the interpretation at an exhibition, as well as the interpretation of the cultural program. The main thing is to discuss it with the interpreter in advance so that he could prepare, set himself up and rate his strength correctly.</p>
        <p>Another thing is when you participate in an exhibition abroad, you have the stand organized and you need 1-2 local interpreters for the employees working at the stand.</p>
        <p>During the work at the exhibition stand, discipline, skill to communicate, physical endurance is required from the interpreter besides purely interpretation skills. During the whole period of exhibition work, Interpreter has to be even-tempered and friendly, readily help to overcome language barrier in communication between stand-assistants and visitors of the stand, as well as between administration of an exhibition and the stand personnel.</p>
        <p>
          It is desirable to provide the interpreter (or interpreters) with advertizing and information materials which are supposed to be used and discussed during an exhibition in advance so that he could prepare, specify the interpretation of necessary terminology. The interpretation will be more successful if from the very beginning you make interpreter’s duties clear and, if possible, inform him about time of the most important business meetings and presentations which are planned at the stand in advance.

    seminar:
      title: "Interpretation at a seminar or conference"
      text: |
        <p>
          You are going to participate in a seminar or conference abroad. And working language of conference, let us say, English, German or French. And you don't know any of them well enough  to do without interpretation service.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>First variant:</b>
          you fly to a seminar or conference as audience, and you need interpreter. You aren’t going to make report from a tribune and throughout all the conference you sit and listen in a hall, so the invited  interpreter will interpret only for you (unless you wish to ask a question or make a small remark from your place).
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to disturb other participants of a seminar or conference, Interpreter will whisper the translation quietly in your ear.It is a certain kind of whisper interpreting.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Second variant:</b>
          you fly to a seminar or conference as one of speakers who have some time for report.
        </p>
        <p>
          The invited interpreter, as in the first variant, most part of a seminar or conference will whisper the translation quietly in your ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in this case the most responsible moment is the interpretation of your speech for all the audience in the hall. Depending on the size of the room, acoustics and number of participants, it can be performance from a tribune with use of a microphone or simply loud voice without any technical means.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the interpretation the interpreter usually stands near for not only to hear each word told by you well, but also to have an opportunity to ask something again if necessary. It is ideal when there are microphones. Even if the room is not very big. Then neither you, nor the interpreter should force your voice. And audience will hear everything equally well even in the last row.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strong consecutive interpreter will be suitable for the successful interpretation of a seminar or conference. Weaker and less skilled interpreter will need much more time for interpretation. And time at conferences is usually not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be very difficult for simultaneous interpreter who seldom uses consecutive interpretation to memorise and interpret big extracts from memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, successful interpretation at the seminar or conference, especially on any highly specialized subjects, is, as a rule, impossible without good knowledge of the corresponding subject and terms in two languages. If the subject is unfamiliar for the interpreter, he will need more days to get ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          Appearance of the interpreter is also very important when interpretation is made from tribune. Here is much in common with Interpretation of presentations.
        </p>
    presentation:
      title: "Interpretation at presentation"
      text: |
        <p>
          You fly to the city abroad to presentation, for example, of new equipment as ordinary participant and auditor and you need the interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case interpretation differs little from interpretation at any other mass event (conference, meeting, round table). You need strong interpreter able to adapt quickly to unusual situation and, certainly, understanding and having experience of interpretation in that field of knowledge, which the presentation subject belongs to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conditions and interpretation quality will depend on your status at this presentation and correspondingly the place you will watch the presentation from. If you are one of special guests and sit in presidium, it is one situation. If you are ordinary visitor and sit somewhere in a hall rather far from the stage, it is another situation. It is difficult to provide ideal interpretation without special equipment. Therefore interpretation by whisper will be the most suitable variant, i.e. the interpreter whisper to you in your ear. That’s why it is very important to choose such a place, where you can hear everything well and at the same time the interpretation would not disturbs other participants of presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you act as organizer and the main speaker and you plan to hold presentation of your new product or service for potential foreign partners (no matter in your country or abroad), depending on the venue, number of participants and technical equipment available at presentation, consecutive or simultaneous interpretation can be applied
        </p>
        <p>
          Consecutive interpretation is more often at presentation with a small number of participants and one pair of working languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simultaneous interpretation will be more suitable for official long presentations with a large number of participants and necessity to provide interpretation into several languages at once (for example, not only into English, but also into German or Chinese).
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike other kinds of consecutive interpretation, at  presentations  special attention is paid to appearance, official style of clothes and adequate gestures of the interpreter, and sometimes even to such factors, as age and sex of the interpreter. Eventually, you are to choose, which interpreter will suit you best for interpretation at presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clarity of presenting, exact interpretation of terms, correctly placed accents are very important for interpretation of presentations. Therefore it is desirable for interpreter not only to know the subject well, but also to have the opportunity to see the full text of presentation several days before its start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interpreter should have clear articulation and loud voice to provide high-quality interpretation at presentations. Anyway, additional microphones for interpreter and for questions from the audience will help to make presentation more effective and  to facilitate perception of the interpretation even in the small room. It is better to think about them in advance.
        </p>
    clinic:
      title: "Interpretation of a consultation in a clinic"
      text: |
        <p>You go to foreign clinic for consultation or treatment, and you need local interpreter good at medicine.</p>
        <p>Medical interpretation is one of the most difficult types of interpretation. In this case it is always very important to  interpret the diagnosis exactly, as well as medical appointments and recommendations. The interpreter who confuses liver and spleen, won't suit you.</p>
        <p>To get competent interpretation at a visit of foreign clinic or at consultation with foreign doctor, as a rule, you need medical interpreter not just of general profile, but the interpreter with knowledge of certain area of medicine  which the disease belongs to. The interpreter who  copes successfully with interpretation on all-medical subjects, will not always  be able to interprets consultation on urology or gynecology the same successfully . It is necessary to mention stomatology among the sections of medicine that are most difficult for interpretation . Anyway while choosing the interpreter for visit of medical institutions abroad, it is necessary to consider how detailed the consultation will be; whether subtleties of medical diagnosis and methods of treatment will be discussed or you are going to discuss only some general questions, for example, possibility of hospitalization.</p>
        <p>If you have some written extracts and  conclusions concerning planned consultation in hand, it is better to translate them  into corresponding language in written form in advance   and, certainly, to give the interpreter  chance to see originals and the translations. If, for any reason, translation  wasn't made, the interpreter will have to translate these medical documents at a consultation at sight,  it can be extremely difficult and won't allow you to get desirable result from consultation.</p>
        <p>Interpreter’s ability to understand accompanying financial documentation is not less important aspect, than correct interpretation of medical terminology. Quite often the patient finds out very late about the real cost of hospital treatment received by him abroad.</p>

        <p>
          You fly to the city abroad to celebrations or business partners’, friends’, etc. festive event  - and you need local interpreter who will help you to participate in planned celebration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such events, where you need help of personal interpreter, can be very different: City Day, company anniversary, corporate party, New year, wedding, etc. Type of interpreting and corresponding skills, necessary for the interpreter, will differ a little depending on format and venue of festive event or celebration (company office, theater, restaurant, recreation area), number of invited guests, level of officiality and your role at the event, whether you present as ordinary participant or as one of special guests.
        </p>
        <p>
          At escorting and interpreting at festive event, besides brisk and live interpretation, not of less importance is  interpreter’s skill to communicate, ability to behave in official situation, smartness, presentable appearance, moderate use of alcoholic beverages.
        </p>
        <p>
          From purely interpretation skills, ability to interpret solemn speeches, jokes and anecdotes, knowledge of everyday language, proverbs and sayings can be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are going to make a long official speech at the event, it is desirable  to give the full text to the interpreter in advance (in 1-2 days), for information and preparation. And it is even better to take care of translating the text of your speech into a foreign language.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you don’t have prepared text of your speech, if possible, try to let the interpreter know what you are going to speak about, and discuss those words and expressions which can cause additional difficulty during spontaneous interpretation. While choosing the interpreter, from the very beginning it is desirable to find out  whether he happened to interpret at such events before, as well as to discuss with interpreter the  program planned and the part which he will have in it.

    guide:
      title: "Interpretation of excursions, tour guide services"
      text: |
        <p>
          You plan a trip to the city abroad and you want to find local guide-interpreter who would arrange you a tour in English around local attractions. What requirements should be imposed to such guide?
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, it is desirable for such guide-interpreter to know English well as native or as main foreign language. Fortunately, in many foreign countries English is either the main or one of the main languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially, if it is a question of some famous city or large tourist center. Secondly, it is desirable that he had experience of conducting excursions in English on subject that is interesting  for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of things depend on, whether we speak about usual sightseeing tour around local sights, or you wish to order some special theme excursion: for example, to musical or literary places.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, it is  better to discuss all your wishes in advance, including duration of excursion and how profound it has to be.</p>
        <p>There can be another situation. You fly to the city abroad, and you would like to visit tour which is conducted in the language you don't know. That’s why you need local interpreter for interpretation of the tour guide.</p>
        <p>As for organization, when such excursion are conducted for one person or for small group of tourists, the most different variants are possible, depending on the country and local traditions and customs.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, for the guide, who conducts this tour, presence of interpreter will be a stirring factor. On the other hand, it will be additional opportunity to take rest while the interpreter speaks.</p>
        <p>But not all guides are used to work together with interpreter.</p>
        <p>
          As for interpreter, in this case he doesn’t need to know all details. The main thing for him is to interpret accurately everything tour guide will tell into your language, without distortions and with minimum admissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides, it is necessary to consider the fact that because of time spent for the interpretation (including inevitable questions and specifications), duration of excursion can increase from one and a half to two times. And if time, allowed for excursion, is fixed, the tour guide will tell you one and a half-two times less useful information. Even if he is interpreted by superinterpreter

    delegations:
      title: "Escort of delegations"
      text: |
        <p>
          You fly with partners or colleagues to the city abroad, and you need local interpreter to accompany you all over the route, starting from hotel or directly from airport of destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          When delegation goes abroad, the choice of the interpreter in many aspects depends on type and delegation structure,  planned program and purposes of visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway it is  supposed that the interpreter  has already had experience of successful business interpreting for delegations of such kind. Strong interpreter of general profile who knows well main subjects, which are planned to be discussed during the trip, as well as local realities will be the best for this role.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does not necessarily have to be the simultaneous interpreter, because here consecutive interpreting is needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interpretation for delegation is especially responsible. The interpreter will not only interpret but also stay almost constantly with delegation during all the time of its stay in the country. That’s why not the last role is played by good physical form and readiness to work for 15-16 hours per day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best for this role is active and sociable person of young or middle age who, besides interpreting at official meetings and visits, will always willingly  help not only to the head of delegation, but also to any other member, to solve some questions with hotel, etc., which are out of the official program.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a word, you are to choose! Choose the interpreter  who you will feel most comfortable with during a foreign trip.
        </p>
    individuals:
      title: "Escort of individuals"
      text: |
        <p>
          You fly to a city abroad, and you need local interpreter for accompanying you all over the route, starting from the airport or hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, a lot of things depend on duration, program and purposes of visit. As it will be escort of individual, besides interpretation qualification, personal compatibility between individual business tourist and the interpreter accompanying you is very important.
        </p>
        <p>
          To choose the interpreter, a lot of things depend on the program planned. To what extent this interpreter will suit you at private foreign trip is possible to see according to CV, in particular, by the themes of interpreting specified by the interpreter. In certain cases additional specifying questions can be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are going to visit shops, restaurants, beaches, beauty salons or other places for rest and entertainment, the interpreter has to be sociable party-goer who knows shops, restaurants, and other haunts of vice well. Usually guide-interpreters know them well as they initially specialize on showing guests the places which should be visited by all means. If you are going to visit sports constructions or a hippodrome, you’d better choose the interpreter who is interested in the same sports, as you, and is able to give some additional information besides the interpretation. If the interpreter specified in the CV that he interprets "Sports", probably, he is just theinterpreter you need. But it is always better to check.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your individual program includes generally visiting of the museums, it is better to choose the interpreter who is interested in history, art, technics and is able to act not only as ordinary interpreter, but also as the guide to the most interesting noteworthy places. The local guide-interpreter or the interpreter who has specified "Art" as one of subjects for interpretation will suit you best for such a trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, it is important to decide and discuss with the interpreter the schedule of his work in advance: whether he has to accompany you 24 hours a day minus time for sleep and rest or you plan to use interpretation service only occasionally  for several hours a day (for example, for the interpretation of important business meetings or excursions to noteworthy places).

    phone_talking:
      title: "Interpretation of a phone conversation"
      text: |
        <p>
          As means of communication are improving  and communication lines’ quality gets higher, interpretation by phone becomes more and more demanded interpretation service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's say you go to a foreign city, and you are to have a phone conversation (for example, from hotel, meeting room of business center, cafe, etc.). And you need the local interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is necessary to consider while choosing the interpreter for  phone talk interpretation? First of all, modern means of communication allow us to make a remote telephone interpretation. For this purpose it is possible to use teleconference mode with simultaneous dialing of several subscribers to certain number. In this case all three (the subscriber 1, the subscriber 2 and the interpreter) can be in three different places. The total cost of communication services for such remote negotiations lasting one hour can be rather high.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another variant - usual Hands free on any stationary modern telephone set, modern mobile phone or smartphone. In this case, the interpreter is near you, interprets in turn to both parties, if necessary asks again, etc. The main requirements to the interpreter at interpretation of a phone conversation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            understanding of the subject and knowledge of the corresponding terminology; ability to perceive foreign speech well;
          </li>
          <li>
            ability  to interpret quickly to both parties (preferably in simple and clear phrases);
          </li>
          <li>clear articulation and good pronunciation in a foreign language.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For the interpretation of a phone conversation both simultaneous, and consecutive interpreter will be good. Everything depends on a certain situation and on the way how to organize interpretation process. It is desirable to discuss with the interpreter in advance what and how he has to interpret, tell him subject and purpose of phone call. It will allow him to interpret with more sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway it is necessary to approach seriously to choosing interpreter for a phone talk interpretation. He has to be strong interpreter able to understand and interpret correctly what was told on the other end of the line, even in conditions of poor audibility or by sentence fragments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When interpreter is asked to arrive specially in due time to office, hotel or business center for interpreting of phone conversation, it is necessary to consider that the called subscriber can be out (he can be at an urgent meeting, etc.). In this case planned telephone negotiations won't take place. In order to avoid similar problems it is desirable to coordinate  with the subscriber in advance time of a call and approximate duration of conversation. Also it is necessary to consider that in case of not simultaneous, but consecutive interpretation, you will need more time.
        </p>
    interview:
      title: "Interview interpretation"
      text: |
        <p>
          You fly to the city abroad, and you have an interview to mass media in the visit schedule: you can’t cope without the qualified interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of things depend on how interview is organized. Different variants are possible:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.</strong>
          The interpreter interprets immediately not only questions, which you are asked, but also your answers . The interviewer records all this on a dictophone and after some time full or reduced variant goes to air.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case greater demand is made on interpreter’s qualification. At a certain extent it is even more difficult, than simultaneous interpretation. Consecutive interpreter of the high qualification, who is able to remember big pieces of the text and, preferably knows a method of interpreter’s shorthand, will cope with the interview interpretation most successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be slightly more difficult for simultaneous interpreter as he should interpret consecutively. And not all simultaneous interpreters are able to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2.</strong>
          Interview goes on the air or (that’s almost same) records at once for air. In this case there are a lot of restrictions for the interpreter complicating his difficult work. Interviewers will tell the interpreter where he has to stand (to be or, on the contrary, not to be in a shot), at what time he can say interpreted text, with what loudness, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3.</strong>
          The simplest variant, but happening less often: the invited interpreter interprets you the questions. You answer separately each question. Questions together with your answers are recorded on a dictophone. And in several days interview shorthand report translated into foreign language as it is going to bepublished in foreign newspaper or magazineit is send to you for coordination. You order to this or other interpreter the return translation of the interview text  in English and, if necessary, you introduce corrections in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway it is desirable to inform  the interpreter in advance what format an interview will be, so that he could gauge his strengths and opportunities. Certainly, in equal conditions, the preference should be given to the interpreter who  has already had experience of interview interpretation. Literary speech in foreign language, the clearness of a pronunciation and partly appearance of the interpreter are of great importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpretation of interview will be more successful if you show questions to interpreter in advance, as well as discuss correct translation of key concepts mentioned in interview, names of positions and organizations.
        </p>
    press_conference:
      title: "Interpretation at press conferences"
      text: |
        <p>
          You take part in press conference to answer questions of foreign journalists. Interpretation at press conferences – one of the most responsible and intensive types of interpretation which  demands great concentration and attentiveness from the interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpretation at press conferences has much in common with interview interpretation, but with difference that press conference takes place in more official atmosphere, and questions are asked not by one-two, but by a large number of representatives of mass media at once. And, unlike interview interpretation, questions are practically never  coordinated in advance with respondent and can be asked spontaneously by anyone who is present at press conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          For interpetation at press conferences the skilled interpreter is usually invited, who has skills  of both consecutive and simultaneous interpretation. To only simultaneous interpreter it will be rather difficult to interpret from memory long and confused speeches during press conference.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter has to be trim, behave confidently, be very exact when interpreting. If he hasn't understood part of the answer, it is better to ask again once more, than fantasize and give out wrong interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is desirable if possible,  to inform the interpreter in advance about subject of press conference and those questions which can be mentioned. Then the interpreter will be able to prepare better for the interpretation, and his interpretation will be more certain and qualitative. If there is a prepared text of communique or press release, it is desirable to show them to the interpreter before press conference. And it is even better – to charge beforehand the professional translator  to translate these texts in written form into foreign language. The written list of all participants of press conference in both languages will be big help for the interpreter.
        </p>

    protocol_translation:
      title: "Protocol interpretation"
      text: |
        <p>
          Diplomatic or protocol interpretation has much in common with interpretation at negotiations. With only difference that in this case meetings have more official, protocol character. Correspondingly, besides interpretation quality, observance and following a number of formal moments and rules, connected with diplomatic and business etiquette, including strict business suit, a tie, etc., by the interpreter is important.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interpreter has no right to disclose any information of internal character which he finds out as a result of preparation and participation in such official meeting as the interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          At protocol meetings seating chart, including place of the interpreter, is strictly regulated. Usually the interpreter sits on the right or on the left of the delegation head  who he came with. But there are exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important that at representation and during the meeting the interpreter  told all names, positions, titles and names of establishments correctly. In order to avoid unpleasant incidents it is better to instruct  the interpreter in advance, by providing him with information on names, positions and concepts which can cause additional difficulties for interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the diplomatic or protocol interpretation when the head of delegation speaks, he is usually interpreted by "own" interpreter into a foreign language (for example, into Spanish or German). And when the head of foreign delegation takes the floor, he isalso  interpreted by "own" interpreter, usually into nonnative English.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is considered that "own" interpreter knows a question matter in detail, possesses necessary background information and – the main thing! – won't allow ideological distortions when interprets his chief’s thoughts into a foreign language, will tell everything "as it is necessary". And small style abruptness isn't of great importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides it is always possible to hold own interpreter responsible for incorrect or incomplete interpretation. It is easier to correct him or even to give him a cue if he has difficulty with interpretation of some nuances. And it won't be breach of diplomatic protocol or business etiquette.
        </p>

    judicial_translation:
      title: "Judicial interpretation"
      text: |
        <p>
          Let's say you go to the city abroad at a court session as a claimant, respondent or representative  - and you need local judicial interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many countries there is a special exclusive category of so-called "sworn interpreters". Sometimes they are called simply "judicial interpreters".
        </p>
        <p>
          As a rule, the interpreter who is the employee of claimant’s or respondent’s company  has no right to act as interpreter at trial as in this case objectivity of interpretation can't be guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
          If English-speaking tourist or businessman is detained as the individual for administrative offenses and furthermore on suspicion in commission of any criminal offenses on the territory, say, Germany or France, certainly, he won’t be engaged in search of the interpreter. It will be done by local police officers or judicial authorities. But if you act as a claimant or respondent at trial in arbitration court or at court hearing in a civil action, you can try to invite and offer court the candidate of the independent sworn interpreter of your choice. The right of court to accept or reject such interpreter.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the successful interpretation at court, besides good skills of oral consecutive interpretation, the interpreter needs knowledge of legal language of that branch of the right which judicial proceedings belong to. For example, civil, commercial or marine law are very different areas with the specific terms and legal nuances. In equal conditions it is always better to choose the interpreter who  has already had experience of successful interpretation at similar trials.  First of all, interpreter’s absolute understanding of the language which legal proceedings are conducted in is important, as well as ability  to interpret quickly and correctly all questions, answers and legal statements of two parties. It is supposed that any certified "sworn interpreter" just by definition meets all these qualification requirements. But if in this certain country there is no legalized category of sworn or judicial interpreters, it is better to find out in advance, what formal requirements to interpreters are imposed by judicial authorities of this country to admit them to interpretation at judicial hearings, at poll of witnesses, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, the first thing for the interpreter is to have document confirming his qualification (university diploma of interpreter or certificate on passing of corresponding exam) and - as the second important factor - (not for court, but for the customer of interpretation) if the interpreter has experience of professional interpretation at court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not depending on whether it will be official sworn interpreter or just strong interpreter who knows legal nuances, for successful interpretation at court it is desirable to acquaint the interpreter in advance at least in general with case papers and positions of the parties in judicial dispute.
